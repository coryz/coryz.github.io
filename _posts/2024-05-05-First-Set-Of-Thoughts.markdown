I've been exploring the concept of a creative outlet for a while. I'm not really artistically inclined (although I do remember enjoying drawing as a child), so this space will have to do for the time being. I've seen references to a concept of a "Digital Garden" that resonates with me so there's no better time to start than now.

I'd like to think about a couple of topics as I start.

* Fatherhood
* Opportunities for Growth
* Learning to learn
* Hobbies
    - The AI revolution
    - Gym
    - Video Games
    - Chess
    - Sports
        + NBA
        + Olympics in 2024
        + Team Sports vs Individual Sports & Team Dynamics

Ultimately, I really just want a space to organize my thoughts, to improve my writing, and to get into a practice of having some outlet of expression.
